This will act as a ReadMe file for my functions respository.

This respository will be used to catalog all of the functions i have created
over the course of my grad program using Python

If functions become a large part of R or other langauge learning
i will create another respository for those languages.

This respository will be open to the public for anyone to use and change
the functions for whatever purpose that they may see fit.
